# Lucidian

An Obsidian plugin that embeds AI as a sidebar chat interface. Your vault directory becomes the AI's working directory, giving it full agentic capabilities: file read/write, bash commands, and multi-step workflows.

## Name

**Lucidian** — from *Lucid* + *Obsidian*.

*Lucid* (Latin *lucidus*: light, clear) means clear thinking, easy to understand, bright and luminous. Lucidian is the AI that makes your knowledge lucid — turning your vault into a space where complexity becomes clarity.
